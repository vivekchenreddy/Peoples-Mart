This project is inspired by my University's pantry which helped students and staff in the time of Covid-19. It's a Web application for Binghamton City to share the extra food in a household or left after any event. Anyone who wants to share the food can login as a donator.

A Donator have to do the following things:-

1) Click the picture of the food, describe the type and quantity of food, etc.

2) Add the address for pick up, and post the ad.
People who registered as requestors will receive a notification about the ad.
